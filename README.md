# Overview
WorkerPool is a Node.js module designed for managing and executing asynchronous tasks efficiently with a limited number of workers. It leverages event-based task handling to support task prioritization, retries, and graceful shutdowns. This utility is ideal for scenarios where controlling concurrency and managing task execution are critical.
